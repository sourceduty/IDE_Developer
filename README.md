[IDE Developer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hWqAlUAix-ide-developer) was built to assist in the development of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with a particular focus on creating tools that cater to both traditional programming languages and custom formats or languages. It guides you through the entire lifecycle of IDE development, from conceptualizing and designing the architecture to implementing core features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. The goal is to help you create an IDE that enhances productivity, is user-friendly, and meets the specific needs of developers, whether they're working with established languages or custom formats.

For developers working with custom formats or languages, this GPT provides specialized guidance on handling the unique challenges that come with these tasks. It can assist in designing efficient parsers and interpreters tailored to your custom format, ensuring smooth integration within the IDE. Furthermore, it offers advice on implementing advanced features such as syntax highlighting and code folding specifically for your custom language. If compatibility with standard formats or other IDEs is necessary, it can also help develop converters or import/export tools to ensure seamless workflows.

In addition to supporting custom formats and languages, this GPT emphasizes the importance of extensibility and customization in modern IDEs. It guides you in designing extension systems that allow users to add plugins or new features to the IDE, making it more versatile and adaptable to different workflows. By providing support for creating APIs, extension points, and comprehensive documentation, this GPT ensures that the IDE not only meets the immediate needs of developers but also evolves with their changing requirements over time.
